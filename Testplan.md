# Test Plan: Cleango App

## Introduction
The test plan outlines the testing approach and strategies for the Cleango App, emphasizing the setup of automated testing frameworks and their integration with development activities.

## Objectives
1. Implement an efficient testing framework.
1. Ensure comprehensive test coverage for critical functionalities.
1. Facilitate development cycles with automated testing.
1. Validate the app's stability and reliability before and after deployment.

## Scope
- Initial focus on setting up testing frameworks alongside development.
- Testing will cover functional, usability, and performance aspects.
- Emphasis on continuous integration (CI) and gradual test expansion.

## Test Approach
1. **Test Types:**
   - Automated tests: Unit, integration, and UI tests.
   - Manual tests: Exploratory, smoke, and regression tests.

1. **Test Environments:**
   - Development Environment: Mirrors production for development.
   - Staging Environment: For final testing before deployment.

1. **Testing Tools:**
   - Automated Testing Frameworks: [To be discussed].
   - Real-time Monitoring Tools: [To be discussed].

1. **Testing Strategies:**
   - Agile Development: Iterative cycles with test integration.
   - Gradual Test Expansion: Incremental increase in automated test coverage.
   - Continuous Feedback Loop: Gathering feedback for test enhancements from various sources - Testers, Developers, Stakeholders; making improvements based on the received feedback

## Test Phases

1. **Environment Setup (Week 1-2):**
   - Setup of development and testing environments.
   - Selection and installation of testing frameworks/tools.
   - Introduction of CI/CD pipelines for automated build, test, and deployment.


1. **Automated Testing Framework Setup (Week 3-4):**
   - Implementation of automated testing frameworks.
   - Integration of automated tests into CI/CD pipelines for immediate feedback on code changes.
   - Definition of initial test suites and strategies.


1. **Development with Test Integration (Week 5 onwards):**
   - Agile development cycles alongside automated test writing.
   - Continuous integration and testing (both manual and the already implemented automated tests).

1. **Staging Environment and Manual Testing (Week 9-10):**
   - Setup of staging environment for final testing.
   - Execution of manual tests and exploratory testing, alongside with the automated tests.
   - Agile development cycles based on the test results.

1. **Gradual Deployment and Test Expansion (Week 11 onwards):**
   - Controlled deployment supported by automated tests.

1. **Post-Deployment Activities:**
   - Incremental expansion of test coverage.
   - Agile development cycles based on the test results.

## Conclusion
The test plan aims to establish an effective testing framework and integrate it seamlessly into the development process, ensuring code quality, stability, and reliability of the Cleango App.
